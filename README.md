# Lost & Found Project

A premium, modern web application for reporting and finding lost items.

## How to Run

1.  Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
    -   You can double-click the file in your file explorer.
    -   Or right-click and select "Open with" -> Google Chrome / Edge / Firefox.

## Features

-   **Report Found Items**: Upload a photo, add a description, location, and contact info.
-   **Browse Items**: View all reported items in a responsive grid.
-   **Search**: Filter items by name or location.
-   **Local Storage**: Data is saved in your browser, so it persists even if you refresh the page.
-   **Premium Design**: Glassmorphism UI, smooth animations, and responsive layout.

## Note

Since this is a client-side only application, the data is stored in your browser's `localStorage`. If you clear your browser data, the items will be removed.
