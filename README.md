## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I improved my understanding of:

- Dynamic Content Rendering
- Theme Switching Logic
- Responsive Web Design

---

## Features

-   **Report Found Items**: Upload a photo, add a description, location, and contact info.
-   **Browse Items**: View all reported items in a responsive grid.
-   **Search**: Filter items by name or location.
-   **Local Storage**: Data is saved in your browser, so it persists even if you refresh the page.
-   **Premium Design**: Glassmorphism UI, smooth animations, and responsive layout.

## Note

Since this is a client-side only application, the data is stored in your browser's `localStorage`. If you clear your browser data, the items will be removed.

## 🌟 Future Improvements

- Add backend integration (Node.js / Database)
- Add user authentication system
- Add image upload feature
- Add search and filter functionality
